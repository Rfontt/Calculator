# About project:

A long time ago, in technical high school, one of the computer teachers asked the whole class to do a simple calculator project to train the knowledge acquired in JS. Today, I decided to redo this project and saw how much has evolved since that day. I put the same background and the logic was the same, but in a very short time I finished compared to that year.

**I say, every programmer must make a calculator.**
